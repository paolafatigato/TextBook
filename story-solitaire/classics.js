/**
 * STORY SOLITAIRE - stories inspired by famous books and tales (loaded after levels.js, before grammar.js).
 * They join the other stories: every deal takes 4 at random. When the pupils read the story they get a line that sends them to the original.
 * To add one: copy a block. text = 5 short sentences, each cut in two halves with " | " (sentences separated by " / "), so 10 cards.
 * spec = the 10 grammar tokens, see grammar.js (use X for a half that does not fit with anything else).
 * Write them in your own words (short summary of the plot, past simple, American English).
